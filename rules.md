# Cthulhu Dawn Guild Rules

Cthulhu Dawn is first and foremost a social guild. As such, we focus on fun, friendship and a sense of community.
Although hardcore gaming is not our main purpose, we do strive to better our knowledge of the game and help one another reach endgame achievements.
The following rules are the official terms by which we expect ALL members to abide:
**Be helpful to others, and the guild as a whole. Show respect to everyone, and try to go a little out of the regular grind in order to have loads of fun and adventures with your peers.**

## Rules of Conduct

- We have two official in-game guilds in Guilds Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls Online. We encourage you to join those guilds *if* you play those games. We no longer hold people to a particular game. We appreciate those who join in the Discord or guild chat just to say hi, be helpful, or otherwise interact with fellow guildies. 
- Be respectful of others. Do not belittle or otherwise be rude to other guild members. Respect others' opinion, religion (except for when it calls for hate) and sexuality, even if you disagree.
- Any discrimination, begging, or abuse of members (including, but not limited to name calling, stalking, sexual harassment, or other unwanted attention) whether in the forums, in Discord or in game will not be tolerated. Please respect your fellow guildies and treat others as you would like to be treated.
- If/when guild events are organised, they are for the whole guild. If you don't feel like joining, that is your choice but don't do anything that blocks or interrupts the events or fellow guildies. Please respect the effort made to organize such events.
- We are a guild, which means we're there for each other. As such, appropriate compensation is warranted for materials and time. Do not rip off your fellow guild mates, NOR beg, use, and freeload from your fellow guild mates.
- Any possible ranking will be given the way we see fit. Begging for a higher rank or even demanding one, will rather get you a demotion than a promotion.
- Take notice that we as a guild will distance ourselves from anyone in violation to ArenaNet's [Terms of Service](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/) (Guild Wars), Zenimax's [Terms of Service](https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/code-of-conduct?_ga=2.248551559.1217313051.1547480923-1405072604.1541967355) (Elder Scrolls Online), Digital Extremes' [Terms of Service](https://www.warframe.com/terms) (Warframe), and any other platform where our guild is represented.

## Communication

### External communication

Keep in mind that you are running around with our magnificent CD tag. This means that all of your actions, whether good or bad will reflect on the guild.

### Internal communication

- Mature topics, for example those of a sexual nature, can be discussed in guild chat but should a member express discomfort, you are expected to cease discussion and change topics.
- WTS/WTB is ok within reason. Just keep in mind guild chat is not your own personal trading bazaar, so keep spamming to a minimum.
- It is acceptable to ask for assistance, but if others are busy or not able, do not become a pest in chat.
- Don't expect replies from everyone. People often have their hands full and might not be paying attention to chat.
- We are an international guild and with that comes the language barrier. It's always fun to find others that are speaking the same language as you do, but don't talk in guild chat or Discord in any other language than English. That way everyone understands and there's no room for misinterpretation. Whatever language you use in any other chat is your choice.

### Discord

- Discord is strongly recommended. Voice chat is not required, but Discord is our guild chat due to multiple gaming guilds. Most announcements are made there.
- All internal communication rules apply to, but are not limited to, in-game guild chat, Discord chat and voice channels. The contents of direct messages -- when between guild members -- can and will be subject to these rules, especially when they violate previously stated rules pertaining to respect and harassment of any kind.
- Do not mindlessly yell in Discord. This will simply end up in the yeller being muted. Please refrain from typing everything in all CAPS. This can be interpreted as yelling, be hard to read, and frustrating when trying to communicate.
- Our channels are provided for our guild and only our guild to use. For that reason, server invites are not extended to non-guildies. If a special case requires consideration, please contact guild leadership.
- There is the freedom to speak your heart, just make sure that it also has a meaning for the people that are reading it. No one gains with mindless spamming, except that it builds frustration.

## Violations of Rules

Everyone makes mistakes, and we take that into consideration. However, a repeated disregard for the rules, common courtesy, and overall lack of respect for your fellow guildmates will result in your being removed from the guild. We are a family here. We take care of one another. A pattern of behavior that does not fall in line with the above mentioned rules will not be tolerated, so please do not be surprised if you find yourself on the painful side of the kicking boot.

Actions that comply with guild rules in technicality but not in spirit or otherwise fall into a "gray zone" will be evaluated and acted upon by guild leadership. Guild leadership reserves full authority to take any and all action in all guild matters.

We are trying to maintain a healthy community, something which cannot grow with bad apples in the bunch. Everybody is born with common sense--use it, or notice you might not be as welcome as you think.
