# Cthulhu Dawn Guild Rules

Cthulhu Dawn is first and foremost a social guild. As such, we focus on fun, friendship and a sense of community.
Although hardcore gaming is not our main purpose, we do strive to better our knowledge of the game and help one another reach endgame achievements.
The following rules are the official terms by which we expect ALL members to abide:
**Be helpful to others, and the guild as a whole. Show respect to everyone, and try to go a little out of the regular grind in order to have loads of fun and adventures with your peers.**

## Rules of Conduct

- We have a 100% representation policy. Exceptions to this rule are personal guild storages, being used for storage only.
- Be respectful of others. Do not belittle or otherwise be rude to other guild members. Respect others' opinion, religion (except for when it calls for hate) and sexuality, even if you disagree.
- Any discrimination, begging or abuse of members (including, but not limited to name calling, stalking, sexual harassment, or other unwanted attention) whether in the forums, the Facebook page, in Discord or in game will not be tolerated. Please respect your fellow guildies and treat others as you would like to be treated.
- Guild events are organised for the whole guild. If you don't feel like joining, that is your choice but don't do anything that blocks or interrupts the events or fellow guildies. We spend a great deal of time organizing these, please respect that.
- It is considered unacceptable to 'charge' guild members for assistance in the game. Your interest in helping guildmembers should be genuine, not motivated by profiting from them. Don't demand payment from people requesting assistance. We are a guild, which means we're there for each other.
- Participate in your guild. Teaming, parties, contests, forums, and guild chat are all examples. We understand not everyone may be social butterflies, but we do expect guilds, as a whole, to mingle with each other on a regular basis.
- Any possible ranking will be given the way we see fit. Begging for a higher rank or even demanding one, will rather get you a demotion than a promotion.
- Take notice that we as a guild will distance ourselves from anyone in violation to ArenaNet's [Terms of Service](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/) (Guild Wars), Zenimax's [Terms of Service](https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/code-of-conduct?_ga=2.248551559.1217313051.1547480923-1405072604.1541967355) (Elder Scrolls Online), Digital Extremes' [Terms of Service](https://www.warframe.com/terms) (Warframe), and any other platform where our guild is represented.

## Communication

### External communication

Keep in mind that you are running around with our magnificent CD tag. This means that all of your actions, whether good or bad will reflect on the guild.

### Internal communication

- Mature topics, for example those of a sexual nature, can be discussed in guild chat but should a member express discomfort, you are expected to cease discussion and change topics.
- No WTS/WTB (within reason). Just keep in mind guild chat is not your own personal trading bazaar.
- No begging for gold, items, or help. Also, asking for assistance is one thing, but if people are clearly unavailable then asking multiple times won't help.
- Don't expect replies from everyone. People often have their hands full and might not be paying attention to chat.
- We are an international guild and with that comes the language barrier. It's always fun to find others that are speaking the same language as you do, but don't talk in guild chat or Discord in any other language than English. That way everyone understands and there's no room for misinterpretation. Whatever language you use in any other chat is your choice.

### Discord

- All internal communication rules apply to, but are not limited to, in-game guild chat, Discord chat and voice channels. The contents of direct messages, when between guild members, can and will be subject to these rules, especially when they violate previously stated rules pertaining to respect and harassment of any kind.
- Do not mindlessly yell in Discord. We don't want other people's ears to bleed and will just end up in you being muted. Please refrain from typing everything in all CAPS. This can be interpreted as yelling, be hard to read, and frustrating when trying to communicate.
- Our channels are provided for our guild to use and our guild only. For that reason, server invites are not extended to non-guildies. If a special case requires consideration, please contact Trauma or Raven.
- There is the freedom to speak your heart, just make sure that it also has a meaning for the people that are reading it. No one gains with mindless spamming, except that it builds frustration.

## Violations of Rules

Everyone makes mistakes, and we take that into consideration. However, a repeated disregard for the rules, common courtesy, and overall lack of respect for your fellow guildmates will result in your being removed from the guild. We are a family here. We take care of one another. A pattern of behavior that does not fall in line with the above mentioned rules, will not be tolerated, so please do not be surprised if you find yourself on the painful side of the kicking boot.
Nonetheless, even complying by those rules but finding the greyzone and exploiting it will be seen as a violation of these rules. We are trying to maintain a healthy community, something which cannot grow with bad apples in between them. Everybody is born with a common sense, use it, or notice you might not be as welcome as you think.
